FileRoulette
============
A script to seek and discover random files on various hosting services.

Introduction
------------
File-Roulette began as a toy project on the X9 Security Discord chat. The original goal was to find random uploadfile.io files by testing random urls to see if they were alive. Since then, we've been tweaking and updating the script, and have expanded it into something bigger than we had previously planned. This project is in a state of flux, constantly growing and evolving as we expand our scope and refine our skills.
